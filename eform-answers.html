<!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="question theme-gold">
  <div class="question-header">
    <div class="qnum">1</div>
    <div class="qtext">
      <h2>Why did you choose this topic?</h2>
      <div class="char-count"><span class="count">~1,480</span> / 3,000 characters</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="answer-card" id="q1">
    <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyAnswer('q1')">Copy</button>
    <p>I chose this topic because it represents the most meaningful and challenging work of my graduate career. When I was assigned as the Graduate Assistant in the Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies (SNHS), <strong>Dr. Shannon Clifford</strong> — the Acting Dean and my mentor — shared her vision for a student leadership program. There was no existing framework, no curriculum, and no prior model. My task was to take that vision and build it from the ground up.</p>
    <p>As an M.S.Ed. student in Student Affairs and College Counseling, I brought an <span class="hl">education lens</span> — curriculum design, assessment, and pedagogy — into a <span class="hl-teal">healthcare leadership context</span>. That intersection became the foundation for the Student Ambassador Program. I designed the leadership curriculum, created assessment tools including a leadership questionnaire and activity interest survey, planned and facilitated two workshops and two ice breaker events, and developed outreach materials for the Healthy Futures Initiative — all within my first semester.</p>
    <p>I chose this topic for Scholarship Week because it sits at a unique crossroads of theory and practice. This was not a hypothetical project or a classroom assignment. It was a real program serving real students, and the lessons I learned — about facilitation, leadership, listening, and iteration — are lessons I believe other students, faculty, and staff can benefit from hearing. I also want to highlight how graduate assistantships can be genuine opportunities for scholarly and professional growth when paired with strong mentorship.</p>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="question theme-teal">

      <h2>What does your project mean to you personally?</h2>

  </div>
  <div class="answer-card" id="q2">
    <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyAnswer('q2')">Copy</button>
    <p>This project changed how I see myself as a professional and as a leader. Before this experience, I understood leadership as a concept I studied in textbooks. After building the Ambassador Program, I understand leadership as something you practice through real decisions, real failures, and real relationships.</p>
    <p>The most personal moment came between my two workshops. After Workshop 1, I realized I had leaned too heavily on content delivery — too much lecturing, not enough space for student voices. I was nervous and tried to control the room. That honest self-assessment was uncomfortable, but it led me to completely redesign Workshop 2. I shifted to a <span class="hl">discussion-driven format</span>, added a post-workshop survey to capture real-time feedback, and co-facilitated with Dr. Clifford. Watching her lead — and learning to listen before I spoke — taught me more about facilitation than any course ever had.</p>
    <p>This program also showed me what it means to build something from nothing. Every detail — from booking rooms and managing a budget to choosing which leadership styles to teach and how to structure case studies — was my responsibility. The logistics were challenging, the curriculum design was iterative, and the time management was relentless. But seeing students engage, hearing them say things like <span class="quote">"I can't wait to see what future events has in store for us,"</span> made every late night worth it.</p>
    <p>On a deeper level, this project connected me to the students I serve. I am not a nursing or health sciences student, but through this work, I found a genuine home in SNHS. The ambassadors trusted me with their growth, and I took that seriously. This project means everything to me because it proved that <span class="hl">mentorship, intentional design, and authentic relationships</span> can build something lasting.</p>

    <p>In its first semester, the SNHS Student Ambassador Program achieved measurable results across four areas: participation, engagement, student feedback, and program infrastructure.</p>
    <p><strong>Participation:</strong> We recruited <span class="hl">20 undergraduate ambassadors</span> from across SNHS — nursing, health studies, and related programs. These students committed to a full year of leadership development activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Events completed:</strong> I planned and facilitated <span class="hl-teal">four events</span> in Fall 2025 — two leadership workshops and two ice breaker community-building events. Workshop 1 focused on leadership styles through case studies and group discussion. Workshop 2 focused on transformational leadership, opening with Simon Sinek's "Start With Why" framework and exploring team dynamics through Patrick Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a Team.</p>
    <p><strong>Student feedback:</strong> Post-workshop survey responses were overwhelmingly positive. Students reported that the workshops helped them understand how to be effective leaders. One wrote: <span class="quote">"B did great! It was an effective way of hearing how I could actually be a good leader."</span> Another shared: <span class="quote">"I really loved this activity that we did with the nursing ambassadors."</span> When asked what they wanted from the program, <span class="hl-coral">100% of survey respondents</span> ranked Leadership and Communication as their top interest area.</p>
    <p><strong>Program infrastructure:</strong> Beyond events, I built a sustainable foundation — a leadership curriculum document, a leadership style questionnaire, an activity interest survey, a full Spring 2026 programming calendar (including a simulation field trip, peer mentorship training, and a Future Leaders Symposium), and outreach materials for the Healthy Futures Initiative, which is connected to a <span class="hl">$10,000 Diversity Innovation Grant</span> focused on building pathways for underserved communities into health professions.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal conclusions:</strong> The most significant conclusion is about facilitation itself. Iterating between workshops — moving from content-heavy delivery to student-centered discussion — produced noticeably higher engagement. Listening to students and redesigning based on their feedback was more effective than any pre-planned curriculum adjustment. Great programs are not built on paper; they are built on relationships.</p>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="question theme-blue">
  <div class="question-header">
    <div class="qnum">4</div>
    <div class="qtext">
      <h2>What is important for the audience to learn from your project?</h2>
      <div class="char-count"><span class="count">~2,280</span> / 3,000 characters</div>

    <p>Three things.</p>
    <p><strong>First, graduate assistantships can be genuine sites of scholarship.</strong> This was not busywork. Building the Student Ambassador Program required me to apply theories of leadership, curriculum design, and student development in a live, high-stakes context. I want the audience to see that GA work — when paired with strong faculty mentorship — can produce original, meaningful contributions to a school's mission.</p>
    <p><strong>Second, iteration matters more than perfection.</strong> My first workshop was not perfect. I over-prepared content and under-prepared for facilitation. But instead of seeing that as a failure, I treated it as data. I added a feedback survey, redesigned the format, and co-facilitated with my mentor. The second workshop was significantly more engaging. The lesson is that <span class="hl">progress — real, honest, reflective progress — beats getting it right the first time</span>. This is especially relevant for students who are afraid to start something because they do not feel ready.</p>
    <p><strong>Third, leadership is learned by doing, not just by studying.</strong> I taught four leadership styles — transformational, democratic, adaptive, and collaborative — but I also had to <span class="hl-teal">practice them in real time</span>. I had to adapt when scheduling fell apart. I had to collaborate with Dr. Clifford and the SNHS team. I had to inspire students to invest in a brand-new program with no track record. Building the Ambassador Program was my own leadership lab, and I believe that kind of applied, experiential learning is the most powerful form of education.</p>
    <p>I also want the audience to see the unique value of <span class="hl-coral">cross-disciplinary work</span>. As an education student embedded in a health sciences school, I brought a different perspective to program design — and that perspective made the program stronger. Monmouth's graduate programs create these intersections naturally through GA placements, and I think we should celebrate and study those crossovers more intentionally.</p>

  <h2><span>Abstract</span></h2>
  <div class="abstract-card" id="abstract">
    <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyAnswer('abstract')">Copy</button>
    <p>This presentation examines the design, implementation, and early outcomes of the SNHS Student Ambassador Program — a one-year leadership development initiative for 20 undergraduate students in the Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies at Monmouth University. Created by a Graduate Assistant under the mentorship of the Acting Dean, the program was built entirely from the ground up, including a leadership curriculum grounded in transformational, democratic, adaptive, and collaborative leadership frameworks; assessment tools such as a leadership questionnaire and activity interest survey; and a full calendar of events including workshops, ice breakers, and community-building activities. During Fall 2025, two leadership workshops and two ice breaker events were facilitated, with post-workshop survey data indicating high student engagement and strong interest in continued leadership and communication development. The presentation focuses on the iterative design process — particularly the facilitator's growth between Workshop 1 and Workshop 2 — and argues that applied, experiential program-building is an effective model for developing leadership skills in both the students served and the graduate student facilitator. Connected to the Healthy Futures Initiative and a $10,000 Diversity Innovation Grant, the program aims to build sustainable pathways for underserved communities into health professions. Implications for graduate assistantship design, cross-disciplinary mentorship, and student leadership programming in health sciences contexts are discussed.</p>
