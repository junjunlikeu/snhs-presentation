## 1. Why did you choose this topic?

I chose this topic because it represents the most meaningful and challenging work of my graduate career. When I was assigned as the Graduate Assistant in the Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies (SNHS), Dr. Shannon Clifford — the Acting Dean and my mentor — shared her vision for a student leadership program. There was no existing framework, no curriculum, and no prior model. My task was to take that vision and build it from the ground up.

As an M.S.Ed. student in Student Affairs and College Counseling, I brought an education lens — curriculum design, assessment, and pedagogy — into a healthcare leadership context. That intersection became the foundation for the Student Ambassador Program. I designed the leadership curriculum, created assessment tools including a leadership questionnaire and activity interest survey, planned and facilitated two workshops and two ice breaker events, and developed outreach materials for the Healthy Futures Initiative — all within my first semester.

I chose this topic for Scholarship Week because it sits at a unique crossroads of theory and practice. This was not a hypothetical project or a classroom assignment. It was a real program serving real students, and the lessons I learned — about facilitation, leadership, listening, and iteration — are lessons I believe other students, faculty, and staff can benefit from hearing. I also want to highlight how graduate assistantships can be genuine opportunities for scholarly and professional growth when paired with strong mentorship.

## 2. What does your project mean to you personally?

This project changed how I see myself as a professional and as a leader. Before this experience, I understood leadership as a concept I studied in textbooks. After building the Ambassador Program, I understand leadership as something you practice through real decisions, real failures, and real relationships.

The most personal moment came between my two workshops. After Workshop 1, I realized I had leaned too heavily on content delivery — too much lecturing, not enough space for student voices. I was nervous and tried to control the room. That honest self-assessment was uncomfortable, but it led me to completely redesign Workshop 2. I shifted to a discussion-driven format, added a post-workshop survey to capture real-time feedback, and co-facilitated with Dr. Clifford. Watching her lead — and learning to listen before I spoke — taught me more about facilitation than any course ever had.

This program also showed me what it means to build something from nothing. Every detail — from booking rooms and managing a budget to choosing which leadership styles to teach and how to structure case studies — was my responsibility. The logistics were challenging, the curriculum design was iterative, and the time management was relentless. But seeing students engage, hearing them say things like "I can't wait to see what future events has in store for us," made every late night worth it.

On a deeper level, this project connected me to the students I serve. I am not a nursing or health sciences student, but through this work, I found a genuine home in SNHS. The ambassadors trusted me with their growth, and I took that seriously. This project means everything to me because it proved that mentorship, intentional design, and authentic relationships can build something lasting.

## 3. Tell us about the results or conclusions of your work.

In its first semester, the SNHS Student Ambassador Program achieved measurable results across four areas: participation, engagement, student feedback, and program infrastructure.

**Participation:** We recruited 20 undergraduate ambassadors from across SNHS — nursing, health studies, and related programs. These students committed to a full year of leadership development activities.

**Events completed:** I planned and facilitated four events in Fall 2025 — two leadership workshops and two ice breaker community-building events. Workshop 1 focused on leadership styles through case studies and group discussion. Workshop 2 focused on transformational leadership, opening with Simon Sinek's "Start With Why" framework and exploring team dynamics through Patrick Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a Team.

**Student feedback:** Post-workshop survey responses were overwhelmingly positive. Students reported that the workshops helped them understand how to be effective leaders. One wrote: "B did great! It was an effective way of hearing how I could actually be a good leader." Another shared: "I really loved this activity that we did with the nursing ambassadors." When asked what they wanted from the program, 100% of survey respondents ranked Leadership and Communication as their top interest area.

**Program infrastructure:** Beyond events, I built a sustainable foundation — a leadership curriculum document, a leadership style questionnaire, an activity interest survey, a full Spring 2026 programming calendar (including a simulation field trip, peer mentorship training, and a Future Leaders Symposium), and outreach materials for the Healthy Futures Initiative, which is connected to a $10,000 Diversity Innovation Grant focused on building pathways for underserved communities into health professions.

**Personal conclusions:** The most significant conclusion is about facilitation itself. Iterating between workshops — moving from content-heavy delivery to student-centered discussion — produced noticeably higher engagement. Listening to students and redesigning based on their feedback was more effective than any pre-planned curriculum adjustment. Great programs are not built on paper; they are built on relationships.

## 4. What is important for the audience to learn from your project?

Three things.

**First, graduate assistantships can be genuine sites of scholarship.** This was not busywork. Building the Student Ambassador Program required me to apply theories of leadership, curriculum design, and student development in a live, high-stakes context. I want the audience to see that GA work — when paired with strong faculty mentorship — can produce original, meaningful contributions to a school's mission.

**Second, iteration matters more than perfection.** My first workshop was not perfect. I over-prepared content and under-prepared for facilitation. But instead of seeing that as a failure, I treated it as data. I added a feedback survey, redesigned the format, and co-facilitated with my mentor. The second workshop was significantly more engaging. The lesson is that progress — real, honest, reflective progress — beats getting it right the first time. This is especially relevant for students who are afraid to start something because they do not feel ready.

**Third, leadership is learned by doing, not just by studying.** I taught four leadership styles — transformational, democratic, adaptive, and collaborative — but I also had to practice them in real time. I had to adapt when scheduling fell apart. I had to collaborate with Dr. Clifford and the SNHS team. I had to inspire students to invest in a brand-new program with no track record. Building the Ambassador Program was my own leadership lab, and I believe that kind of applied, experiential learning is the most powerful form of education.

I also want the audience to see the unique value of cross-disciplinary work. As an education student embedded in a health sciences school, I brought a different perspective to program design — and that perspective made the program stronger. Monmouth's graduate programs create these intersections naturally through GA placements, and I think we should celebrate and study those crossovers more intentionally.

## Abstract

This presentation examines the design, implementation, and early outcomes of the SNHS Student Ambassador Program — a one-year leadership development initiative for 20 undergraduate students in the Marjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies at Monmouth University. Created by a Graduate Assistant under the mentorship of the Acting Dean, the program was built entirely from the ground up, including a leadership curriculum grounded in transformational, democratic, adaptive, and collaborative leadership frameworks; assessment tools such as a leadership questionnaire and activity interest survey; and a full calendar of events including workshops, ice breakers, and community-building activities. During Fall 2025, two leadership workshops and two ice breaker events were facilitated, with post-workshop survey data indicating high student engagement and strong interest in continued leadership and communication development. The presentation focuses on the iterative design process — particularly the facilitator's growth between Workshop 1 and Workshop 2 — and argues that applied, experiential program-building is an effective model for developing leadership skills in both the students served and the graduate student facilitator. Connected to the Healthy Futures Initiative and a $10,000 Diversity Innovation Grant, the program aims to build sustainable pathways for underserved communities into health professions. Implications for graduate assistantship design, cross-disciplinary mentorship, and student leadership programming in health sciences contexts are discussed.
