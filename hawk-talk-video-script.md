**Format:** Casual, talking to camera. No slides needed — just you.
**Tone:** Authentic, enthusiastic, reflective. Like you're telling a friend about your project.

## OPENING — Who you are (~20 sec)

> Hi, I'm Bingjun Li. I'm a second-year graduate student in the M.S.Ed. program in Student Affairs, and I work as a Graduate Assistant in the School of Nursing and Health Studies under Dr. Clifford, the Acting Dean.

## THE HOOK — What you built (~30 sec)

> My project is about how I designed, launched, and grew the SNHS Student Ambassador Program — completely from the ground up. When I started my GA position, there was no program, no curriculum, no events — just a shared vision between me and my mentor. Dr. Clifford had the idea, and together we turned it into a real, functioning leadership development program for 20 to 30 undergraduate students.

## WHAT YOU DID — The work (~40 sec)

> I built everything from scratch — the leadership curriculum, the assessment tools, the event calendar, the outreach materials. We ran two leadership workshops in Fall 2025, plus ice breaker events to build community. The workshops covered transformational, democratic, adaptive, and collaborative leadership through case studies, group discussions, and activities like Simon Sinek's "Start With Why."
>
> What made it interesting is the intersection — I'm an education student designing programming for healthcare students. That unique crossover shaped everything about the program.

## THE GROWTH — What changed (~30 sec)

> Honestly, the biggest growth wasn't just the program — it was me. After the first workshop, I realized I was doing too much lecturing and not enough listening. So I redesigned the second workshop to be discussion-driven, added a post-survey for real-time feedback, and co-facilitated with Dr. Clifford. That shift — from content delivery to genuine facilitation — changed everything.

## WHY IT MATTERS — The takeaway (~30 sec)

> I think the most important lesson is that the best way to learn leadership is to actually build something that matters. This wasn't a classroom exercise — it was real students, real logistics, real challenges. And through it, I learned that great programs start with relationships, that iteration beats perfection, and that leadership is learned by doing.

## CLOSE (~10 sec)

> I'm really excited to share this story at Scholarship Week. Thank you for considering my application.

## Recording Tips

- **Where:** Quiet room, good lighting (face a window). Plain or campus background.
- **Framing:** Head and shoulders, centered. Phone on tripod or propped up at eye level.
- **Length target:** 2:00–2:30 is the sweet spot. Don't stress about hitting exactly 3:00.
- **One take is fine.** Small pauses and "ums" are OK — it's supposed to be informal.
- **Don't read from the script on camera.** Bullet points on a sticky note near the lens is fine.

## Key Bullet Points (for reference near camera)

1. I'm Bingjun Li, M.S.Ed. GA in SNHS under Dr. Clifford
2. Built the Student Ambassador Program from scratch
3. Curriculum, workshops, events, assessments — all designed by me
4. Education × healthcare = unique intersection
5. Biggest growth: from lecturing → listening → facilitating
6. Lesson: leadership is learned by doing
